# Advanced Statistics Final Project
Final project of the 2022 Advanced Statistical Methods class @ UPF Barcelona

This repository contains the relevant files of the final project for the 2022 Advanced Statistical Methods class @ UPF Barcelona taught by Michael Greenacre.

The goal of the project was to analyze a freely chosen dataset with methods studied in class. These methods mainly focused on statistical analysis and visualization of categorical data. As object of interest, I chose a 2004 dataset compiled at the Columbia University during a Speed Dating Experiment. More details are provided in the report.

For an extensive dive into the project please consult the final report uploaded as pdf. Besides that, the repository contains the raw dataset, the preprocessing script (done in python), the preprocessed dataset, and the final analysis script (done in R).
